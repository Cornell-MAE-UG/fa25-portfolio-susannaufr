## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Susanna Aufrichtig Headshot Cropped 2024.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hello! I’m a second-year mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. Throughout high school and my first years of college, I’ve contributed to multiple competitive project teams and research labs, working on mechanical design, system integration, and modeling. I’m particularly interested in rapid prototyping and innovations in mechanical design, and I thrive in fast-paced, interdisciplinary settings.
