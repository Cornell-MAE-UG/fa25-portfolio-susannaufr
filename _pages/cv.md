#### Research
- **SDU Medical Robotics Lab – Research Intern**  
  Odense, Denmark | May 2025 – August 2025  
  - Developed a micro SmartProbe as a laryngoscope tool to aid throat cancer diagnosis for the EU AIRCARE project; designed in CAD, prototyped, and iterated for manufacturability feasibility.  
  - Performed MATLAB-based kinematic modeling of probe mechanics to validate workspace and compute probe extension length and angular orientation for defined target points.

- **Boston University Morphable Biorobotics Lab – Research Intern**  
  Boston, MA | July 2023 – August 2023  
  - Designed and fabricated MR fluid–based soft robotic glove prototype using laser-cut TPE layering, developing accordion joint structures and iterating designs for durability, manufacturability, and fluid channel integrity.  
  - Conducted Instron tensile tests, demonstrating tunable stiffness control via electropermanent magnet integration.

- **Stanford Systems Neuroscience and Pain Lab – Research Intern**  
  Palo Alto, CA | June 2023 – July 2023  
  - Programmed scripts in E-Prime to measure hand dexterity in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy.  
  - Developed REDCap formulas to calculate health measures from patient survey results.

- **Paly Robotics – Mechanical Designer**  
  Palo Alto, CA | August 2020 – May 2024  
  - Team Captain (2023-’24): Led project timelines, outreach, and events for 80-member team. Managed prototyping, design, and assembly of a pivoting disk-shooting robot. First FIRST World Championship qualification since 2020.
